ROADS MOD by FREERADICALX for MINECRAFT 1.6.4

This is my first mod. This is also my first (serious) Java project. It’s messy, but I’ve done my best to keep it more or less organized, commented and readable. But as the golden retriever with the beakers says: “LAWL I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I’M DOING”. All suggestions / pointers / contributions / forks are welcome and encouraged! If you like what this mod does you’re welcome to integrate it into your own but please let me know about any improvements you make and give me credit for the original!

Development on this mod was begun in 1.5.2 and was ported to 1.6.4 and tested for upload to Git. Developed with Forge and MCP in Eclipse Juno on Mac OS X Mavericks (10.9).
